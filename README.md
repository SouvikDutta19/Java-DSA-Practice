# Java-DSA-Practice

This repository contains my daily coding practice in Java, focused on mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The goal is to improve problem-solving skills and strengthen Java programming fundamentals by consistently solving real-world coding problems.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
- String manipulation
- Arrays and 2D arrays
- Recursion and backtracking
- Linked lists, stacks, queues
- Trees and graphs
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Dynamic programming

## ðŸ“… Commit Structure
Each file is named based on the day and problem, for example:
- `Day1_ReverseString.java`
- `Day2_CheckPalindrome.java`
- `Day3_CountVowels.java`

## ðŸš€ Goal
To commit at least 1â€“3 Java + DSA problems daily and build a strong problem-solving foundation.
